# Custom Controller for Agones Game Servers

This Custom Controller example helps manage game servers more easily by tracking and 
logging detailed information whenever they are created, updated, or removed. This improves
your ability to see and control the servers without needing deep technical knowledge.

For detailed instructions refer to the [Agones Documentation](https://agones.dev/site/docs/examples/custom-controller/).
