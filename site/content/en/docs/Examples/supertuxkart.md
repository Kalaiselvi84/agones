  This Supertuxkart example shows how to set up, deploy, and manage a Supertuxkart game server on a Kubernetes cluster using Agones. It highlights an approach to integrate with existing dedicated game servers.
---

## Prerequisite

 To get started, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

  - You have a running Kubernetes cluster.
  
  - Agones is installed on your cluster. See [Agones guide](https://agones.dev/site/docs/installation/install-agones/).

  - Supertuxkart client is downloaded separately to play. See [SuperTuxKart](https://supertuxkart.net/)
  - Example code for Supertuxkart on Agones is available {{< ghlink href="examples/supertuxkart" >}}here{{< /ghlink >}}

## Deploy the Agones Fleet

To apply the fleet configuration to your cluster, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f fleet.yaml
```

When you run this command, it will:
- Initiate the creation of a Supertuxkart game server fleet as defined in your `fleet.yaml`.
- Set up the fleet with 2 replicas, meaning two instances of the game server will be launched.
- Configure each game server to expose the specified container port (8080).
- Apply health check settings, with an initial delay of 30 seconds and subsequent checks every 60 seconds.
- Ensure the deployment strategy is set to `Recreate`, meaning all existing replicas are removed before new ones are created if the fleet is updated.

## Verify Fleet Creation

After applying the fleet configuration, you can check to ensure that the fleet has been successfully created:

```bash
kubectl get fleets
```

Make sure your Supertuxkart servers are all set by checking that their status shows as `Ready`.
This means they're properly configured. Additionally, you can check the status of individual pods within the fleet:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Ensure Supertuxkart pods are active by confirming their statuses are listed as `Running`.

## Allocate a GameServer

Allocate a GameServer from the fleet using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <your-gameserver.yaml>
```

After applying, you can monitor the newly created GameServer resource, its status, and IP:

```bash
kubectl get gameservers
```

## Viewing GameServer Logs

For troubleshooting or to check how your game servers are running, you can look at the logs of a specific pod using:

```bash
kubectl logs -f <supertuxkart-game-server-pod-name>
```

## Connect to the Game Server

After allocating a GameServer from the fleet and obtaining its status and IP, you're ready to connect and play. Hereâ€™s how to use the server IP and port to join the game with the SuperTuxKart client:

**Launch SuperTuxKart**: Open the SuperTuxKart client you downloaded earlier.

**Navigate to Online Play**: From the main menu, select the "Online Play" option.

**Enter Server Details**: Look for an option to "Join" a server by IP or a similar option where you can manually enter server details. Input the IP address and port number you obtained from the `kubectl get gameservers` command.

**Join the Game**: After entering the server details, proceed to join the server. You should now be connected to your Agones-managed SuperTuxKart game server and ready to play.

## Cleaning Up

After playing SuperTuxKart, it's a good practice to clean up the resources to prevent unnecessary resource consumption. Follow these steps to remove them:

### Remove the Fleet

To delete the Agones fleet you deployed, execute the following command. This will remove the fleet along with all the game server instances it manages:

```bash
kubectl delete -f fleet.yaml
```
