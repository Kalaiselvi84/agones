  This Xonotic example shows setting up, deploying, and managing a Xonotic game server on a Kubernetes cluster with Agones. It uses a simple Go wrapper to connect existing game servers with Agones, making it straightforward to run games in the cloud.
---

## Prerequisite

 To get started, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

  - You have a running Kubernetes cluster.

  - Agones is installed on your cluster. Refer to the [Agones guide](https://agones.dev/site/docs/installation/install-agones/).

  - The Xonotic client downloaded for gameplay. Download it from [Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org)

## Deploy the Agones Fleet

Deploy the fleet configuration for your Xonotic servers using the command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f fleet.yaml
```

## Verify Fleet Creation

After applying the fleet configuration, you can check to ensure that the fleet has been successfully created:

```bash
kubectl get fleets
```

Verify that the Xonotic fleet status is `Ready`, confirming that the servers are correctly set up. Further, check the status of individual pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

The Xonotic server pods should be `Running`, indicating they're active and ready for connections.

## Allocate a GameServer

Allocate a GameServer from the fleet using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <your-gameserver.yaml>
```

After applying, you can monitor the newly created GameServer resource, its status, and IP:

```bash
kubectl get gameservers
```

## Viewing GameServer Logs

For troubleshooting or to check how your game servers are running, you can look at the logs of a specific pod using:

```bash
kubectl logs -f <xonotic-game-server-pod-name>
```

## Connect to the Game Server

After allocating a GameServer from the fleet and obtaining its status and IP, you're ready to connect and play. Hereâ€™s how to use the server IP and port to join the game with the Xonotic server:

**Launch Xonotic**: Start the Xonotic client you previously downloaded.

**Multiplayer Mode**: From the main menu, select "Multiplayer".

**Server Connection**: Choose to join a server manually and input the IP and port number you obtained from the `kubectl get gameservers` command.

**Join the Game**: After entering the server details, proceed to join the server. You should now be connected to your Agones-managed Xonotic game server and ready to play.

## Cleaning Up

Post-gameplay, consider cleaning up resources:

### Remove the Fleet

To delete the Agones fleet you deployed, execute the following command. This will remove the fleet along with all the game server instances it manages:

```bash
kubectl delete -f leet.yaml
```

### Remove Allocated GameServers

To delete the allocated game server, execute the following command.

```bash
kubectl delete -f <your-gameserver.yaml>
```
